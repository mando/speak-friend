# Speak Friend

I know this is dumb but I like it :)

## Door

Shoutout to @JacksonGenilson, I found the code in `door.html` on codepen but it looks like it actually lives at:

https://github.com/JacksonGenilson/The-doors-of-Durin---SVG-animation

It's the sickest part of this whole project.

## Everything else

I'm aware this is overly complicated for serving a single html file, but what kind of yak shaver would I be if I didn't make `deno` serve this and then wrap that in a docker container?
